# ResolutionAndDisplayType
This is for part 1 of the settings tutorial. 
I noticed people had a lot of problems with the code so I hope this will help.
I only did some minor testing with it so let me know if there are any problems.
Reminder: you can only see the resolution and display type changes when you BUILD the project. 
You CANNOT fully test this inside the editor. 
Hope this helps all of you!
